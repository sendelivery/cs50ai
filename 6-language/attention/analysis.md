## Layer 3, Head 7

This attention head appears to have learned that the two adverbs in the sentence are related to each other, but not that they modify a verb, at least in the case in which the verb is masked.

Example Sentences:
- The boy [MASK] from left to right.
- The [MASK] flows from top to bottom. (In this sentence, the head also attends to the verb, flows.)
